# Customer relationship management (CRM)

Client manager project developed with Vite, React Router DOM v6.10.0, JSON Server and Tailwind CSS.

It contains a main layout, an Outlet component to render child route elements, loaders for obtaining data and actions to interact with forms/submit buttons. With this project you can manage your clients, add new ones, edit existing client information or delete clients if needed, interacting with a fake REST API created with JSON Server.
